The project is a demo program for the Keil MCB11U10 Board 
using a NXP LPC11Uxx Microcontroller.

Example functionality: 
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   = 12 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK = 48 MHz
   - USB clock              = 48 MHz
   
It demonstrates an USB Composite Device(DFU+MSC+HID).

The USB MSC and HID are recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load generic MSC and HID driver respectively. 
The board LEDs and Push Buttons(S3 and S4) can then be accessed 
from the PC through a custom HID Client Program(HIDClient.exe).
For DFU, install the driver in \USBClass\DFU\Driver
