The project is a demo program for the Keil MCB11U10 Board 
using a NXP LPC11Uxx Microcontroller.

Example functionality: 
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   = 12 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK = 48 MHz
   - USB clock              = 48 MHz
   
It demonstrates an USB Composite Device(MSC+CDC).

The USB MSC is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load generic MSC driver. 
For CDC, install the driver in current directory.

Note: J1-ON, J2-ON, J4-23
